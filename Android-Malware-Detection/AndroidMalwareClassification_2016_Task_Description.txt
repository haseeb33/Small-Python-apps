Task 3: Android Malware Classification

This dataset is created from a set of APK (application package) files collected from the Opera Mobile Store over the period of January to September of 2014. Just like Windows (PC) systems use an .exe file for installing software,
Android use APK files for installing software on the Android operating system.

The permission system is applied as a measure to restrict access to privileged system resources and is considered as the first barrier to malware. Application developers have to explicitly declare the permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file contained in the APK. All official Android permissions are categorized into four types: Normal, Dangerous, Signature and SignatureOrSystem. As dangerous permissions have access to restricted
resources and can have a negative impact if used incorrectly, they require userâ€™s approval at installation.

To be taken as the input of a machine-learning algorithm, permissions are commonly coded as binary variables i.e., an element in the vector could only take on two values: 1 for a requested permission and 0 otherwise. The number of all possible Android permissions varies based on the version of the OS. In this task, for each APK file under consideration, we provide a list of permissions declared in its AndoridManifest.xml file. The class label of
the APK file -- +1 if it is regarded as malicious and -1 otherwise -- is determined by the detection results of security appliances hosted by VirusTotal. Note that adware was not counted as malware in our setting. The participants of CDMC 2016 competition are invited to design a classifier that could best match this result.

The dataset consists of permission information for 61,730 APK files. The first half (30,920 files) of the dataset is use as training data provided with class labels, and the rest of the data (30,810 files) are used for testing without label information. The total number of permissions constitutes up to 583 permissions: including official Android permissions and some variations.
Detailed information of the files is listed below.
